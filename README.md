# Movie Trailer Website #

This is a simple web application created using Python. This web app connects
to the Movie Database API and gathers image and trailer information for
few of my favorite movies. The MovieDatabase() class is used for API
communications and the Movie() database holds each movies info.

## Installation ##

This app requires Python 2.7+ installed. No other 3rd party modules are
currently used. You also need an API key from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
website.

To run app simply run:

`Python entertainment_center.py`
